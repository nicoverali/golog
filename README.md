<p align="center">The Go implementation in Prolog</p>

## General info

This web app is part of a project for **Logic for Computer Science** subject at Universidad Nacional del Sur.

Our teachers had given us a basic website, so we only had to worry about the Prolog's backend, but since I enjoy learning new web technologies, I decided to build my own web app with React.

The real goal was to implement the traditional Go board game in Prolog programming language, to learn about the Logic paradigm. I did it together with a classmate ([Carlos Canavides](https://github.com/CarlosCanavides)), but **that part of the system is not in this repo**.

## Demo version

The original version uses Pengine library to communicate with the backend, which was responsible for making the AI movements and apply all Go rules. Thus in order to serve this web app as a static website, I modified the original version just to be able to demo the UI.

**You can visit the demo version at [Golog demo version](https://golog-nicoverali.netlify.app/)**

## Technologies

The main technology I used was React with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. Then I also used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling, and play a bit with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) too.
